description: Research a market sector and identify candidate stocks

Research the following sector or theme and identify candidate stocks: $ARGUMENTS

The argument can be a traditional sector (e.g., "healthcare", "energy", "financials") or a cross-sector investment theme (e.g., "ai-infrastructure", "defense", "glp-1"). Themes cut across traditional sector boundaries — pull relevant stocks from wherever they sit.

Use web search to analyze the current state of this sector.

**Run sector momentum analysis first** to get quantitative momentum data:
```bash
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/sector-momentum.py --json
```
This provides Mansfield Relative Strength, Weinstein Stage, ROC, and RSI for all sectors. Use it to populate the Sector Momentum & Trend section below.

**Check for sector-specific knowledge:** If a knowledge file exists for this sector (e.g., `knowledge/sectors/semiconductors.md`), read it first for sector-specific metrics, cycle dynamics, sub-sector hierarchy, and common mistakes. This provides informed context before web search.

**For AI-related sectors** (semiconductors, networking, cloud, power/cooling): consult `knowledge/frameworks/capital-flow.md` to identify which supply chain track is at the inflection point and which names benefit.

**Sector-specific scripts:** If the sector has a dedicated data script, run it as well:
- **Crypto:** Run `.venv/bin/python3 scripts/crypto-cycle.py` for the on-chain cycle dashboard (MVRV, NUPL, cycle composite). Reference the output in the analysis.

Cover:

## Sector Overview
- What's driving the sector right now (macro trends, catalysts, headwinds)
- Recent performance vs. S&P 500 (outperforming, underperforming, in line?)
- Key themes (e.g., AI spend, rate sensitivity, regulatory changes)

## Sector Momentum & Trend

Classify the sector's current momentum. This directly drives strategy selection for stocks in this sector.

Use the sector ETF (if available) or a basket of top stocks to assess:

| Factor | Reading | How to Check |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1-week performance | % | Sector ETF or top stocks avg |
| 1-month performance | % | Sector ETF or top stocks avg |
| 3-month performance | % | Sector ETF or top stocks avg |
| Sector vs. S&P 500 (1-month) | Over/under | Compare sector 1-month return vs. SPY 1-month return |
| Sector RSI (14-day) | Value | Sector ETF RSI |

**Momentum classification:**

| Pattern | Classification | Strategy Implication |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| 1W > 0, 1M > 0, outperforming S&P | **Accelerating Up** | Buy strength — momentum entries work. Don't wait for pullback. Trail stops. |
| 1W > 0, 1M > 0, in line with S&P | **Steady Uptrend** | Normal DCA. Buy support tests. Standard sizing. |
| 1W < 0, 1M > 0 | **Pulling Back in Uptrend** | Best entry window — buy the dip. Accelerate DCA. CSP at support. |
| 1W ~0, 1M ~0 | **Sideways/Choppy** | Theta gang territory. Sell premium. Reduce directional bets. |
| 1W < 0, 1M < 0, underperforming S&P | **Downtrend** | Slow DCA only. Accumulate for the turn. Small positions. Save cash. |
| 1W < 0, 1M < 0, RSI < 30 | **Capitulation** | Contrarian buy zone. Aggressive accumulation if thesis intact. |

**Current momentum:** [pick one]
**Evidence:** [1W/1M/3M performance, vs. S&P, RSI]
**Strategy implication:** [what approach stocks in this sector should use — this carries forward to `/plan-stock`]

## Theme Lifecycle Stage

Assess where this sector/theme sits in its lifecycle. This gates how aggressively we pursue candidates.

| Stage | Definition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Emerging** | Early narrative, few players, limited coverage | Aggressive — find first movers |
| **Accelerating** | Adoption inflecting, earnings confirming thesis | Aggressive — ride the wave |
| **Trending** | Mainstream coverage, ETFs launching, broad participation | Selective — only best-in-class |
| **Mature** | Well-known trade, crowded positioning, growth decelerating | Cautious — trim, don't add |
| **Exhausting** | Multiple ETFs, retail crowding, "everyone owns it" | Avoid new entries — look for exits |

**Current stage:** [pick one]
**Evidence:** [2-3 data points — ETF count, media coverage intensity, institutional positioning, earnings growth trajectory]
**Implication:** [what this means for candidate selection below]

## Top Performers
- 3-5 stocks leading the sector and why
- Recent earnings highlights from sector leaders

## Laggards / Turnaround Candidates
- 2-3 stocks underperforming that could be interesting on a pullback
- What would need to change for them to turn around

## Sector Risks
- Key risks that could hurt the sector broadly
- Upcoming events (earnings season, regulatory decisions, macro data)

## Candidate Scoring

Rank 5-10 stocks from this sector using weighted scoring. Score each dimension 1-10:

| Rank | Ticker | Growth (25%) | Valuation (20%) | Moat (15%) | Catalyst (15%) | Technicals (15%) | Options (10%) | **Score** | Verdict |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|---------|

**Scoring guide:**
- **Growth (25%):** Revenue/earnings growth rate vs. peers. >30% = 8-10, 15-30% = 5-7, <15% = 1-4
- **Valuation (20%):** Fwd P/E or PEG relative to sector. Use sector-appropriate benchmarks from `knowledge/frameworks/valuation.md`. Below sector avg = 7-10, in line = 4-6, premium = 1-3
- **Moat (15%):** Competitive advantage durability. Wide moat = 8-10, narrow = 5-7, none = 1-4
- **Catalyst (15%):** Upcoming positive event within 3 months. Strong catalyst = 8-10, moderate = 5-7, none = 1-4
- **Technicals (15%):** Trend + proximity to entry. Uptrend at support = 8-10, extended = 4-6, downtrend = 1-3
- **Options (10%):** Liquid options chain + IV environment. Consult `knowledge/signals/iv-rank-guide.md` — IV Rank >50 = theta gang viable, <25 = LEAPs territory. Liquid + high IV = 8-10, liquid + low IV = 5-7, illiquid = 1-4

**Weighted Score** = (Growth×0.25) + (Valuation×0.20) + (Moat×0.15) + (Catalyst×0.15) + (Technicals×0.15) + (Options×0.10)

**Lifecycle adjustment:** If theme stage is Mature or Exhausting, subtract 1 from all candidate scores. Note this in the table.

**Verdict:** Score ≥7 = Strong, 5-6.9 = Moderate, <5 = Watch Later

**Validate top candidates:** For the top 3-5 scoring stocks, run `technicals.py` to get real data:
```bash
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/technicals.py TICKER1 && .venv/bin/python3 scripts/technicals.py TICKER2
```
Adjust scores based on actual technicals if they differ from web search estimates.

## Relevant ETFs

Identify ETFs that cover this sector or theme:

| ETF | Name | Thesis Match % | IV / Options | Verdict |
|-----|------|---------------|-------------|---------|

For each ETF, note:
- How well it matches the sector thesis (what % of holdings are relevant vs. dead weight?)
- Whether it has liquid options (for theta gang viability)
- Whether DCA into the ETF makes more sense than picking individual stocks

## Top Picks
Highlight the top 2-3 candidates (highest scoring) and suggest next steps:
- Run `/research-stock TICKER` for a deep-dive on fundamentals
- Run `/trade-watch TICKER` to add to watchlist for monitoring
- Run `/plan-stock TICKER` for full pre-trade analysis

If theme lifecycle is **Exhausting**: recommend no new entries — suggest reviewing existing positions instead.

Save the output to `research/sectors/$SECTOR.md` (use lowercase sector name as filename, e.g., `software.md`).
Start the entry with a date separator: `---` followed by `# Sector — SECTOR | YYYY-MM-DD`.
If the file already exists, prepend the new analysis above all previous entries (after the file title). Never remove historical entries.
