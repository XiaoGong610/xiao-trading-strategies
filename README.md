# xiao-trading-agent

A personal portfolio advisor and trading research workspace powered by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

## What This Is

A set of Claude Code custom skills for stock research, portfolio management, and weekly trading plan generation. The agent advises — you execute. Three pillars:

1. **Research** — top-down market scan → sector analysis → stock deep-dives with conviction scoring
2. **Portfolio Review** — cross-account analysis, position management, tax-aware recommendations
3. **Trading Plans** — weekly DCA schedule, limit orders, CC/CSP setups, exit plans

## Weekly Workflow

All skills work independently. The weekly session below is the full end-to-end flow for a portfolio check-in.

```
1. Update accounts       → screenshots → portfolio/accounts/*.md
2. Add new picks         → watchlist.py --add TICKER
3. Triage                → watchlist.py --no-save (identify refresh queue, detect portfolio gaps)
4. Research              → /research-market (always) → /research-sector (batch stale) → /research-stock
5. Plan                  → /plan-stock on top 2-3 picks (user decides)
6. Portfolio review      → /portfolio-review (analysis: how am I doing?)
7. Trading plan          → /trading-plan (prescription: what should I do?)
8. Final dashboard       → watchlist.py (saves 0-WATCHLIST.md + unified HTML dashboard)
```

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Use with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — skills are automatically available as slash commands
3. Set up Python: `python3 -m venv .venv && pip install yfinance plotly matplotlib pandas numpy streamlit`
4. Optional: set `FRED_API_KEY` env var for macro data (free from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html))
5. Run the dashboard: `.venv/bin/python3 scripts/watchlist.py` (primary) or `.venv/bin/python3 -m streamlit run scripts/app.py` (full Streamlit)

Analysis files are gitignored since they contain personal trading data. Knowledge base and scripts are committed.
